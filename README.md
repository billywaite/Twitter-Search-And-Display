# Twitter-Search & Display

Twitter search &amp; display app built with Node, LokiJS, EJS templating, and Twitter's search API. The form uses jQuery to send an AJAX request to a node application, and this AJAX request is made to the api/results route and returns a JSON response. The front end javascript takes care of displaying the data.

## To deploy:
1. Clone to your machine.
2. Run NPM Install to install the node modules.
3. Register the app with Twitter to get API credentials here: https://apps.twitter.com/
4. Run node main.js and visit localhost:8080
